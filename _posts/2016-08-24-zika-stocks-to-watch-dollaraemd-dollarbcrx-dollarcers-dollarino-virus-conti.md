[Aethlon Medical, Inc.][1] ([NasdaqCM: AEMD][2]) creates innovative medical devices to address life-threatening diseases. The Aethlon ADAPT(tm) (Adaptive Dialysis-like Affinity Platform Technology) establishes the basis for a new class of therapeutics that target the rapid elimination of disease enabling particles from the circulatory system of treated patients. The lead Aethlon ADAPT(tm) product is the Hemopurifier(r), a device that addresses a broad-spectrum of viral pathogens as well as tumor-secreted exosomes that suppress the immune system of cancer patients. Aethlon is also operating under two government contracts with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) related the development of a medical device to reduce the incidence of sepsis. Exosome Sciences, Inc. is a majority owned Aethlon subsidiary that is advancing exosome-based strategies to diagnose and monitor cancer and infectious disease progression.

_**Aethlon Medical (Nasdaq: AEMD) Announces Zika Virus Data**_

_**In vitro studies that demonstrate the rapid capture of Zika virus by the Aethlon Hemopurifier**_

SAN DIEGO - August 11, 2016- Aethlon Medical, Inc. (Nasdaq: AEMD), a developer of immunotherapeutic technologies to combat infectious disease and cancer, announced today that its researchers have completed in vitro studies that demonstrate the rapid capture of Zika virus by the Aethlon Hemopurifier(r). The Hemopurifier(r) is a leading broad-spectrum treatment countermeasure against viral pathogens that are untreatable with or resistant to antiviral drug therapies. At present, the immunotherapeutic technology is being advanced through an FDA approved human feasibility study. The Zika studies, which were conducted with small-scale versions of the Hemopurifier(r), demonstrated a 95% clearance of Zika virus from cell culture fluid in 5.5 hours and an approximate 50% clearance of Zika from human blood serum in 5 hours.

The studies were conducted with the Zika viral strain that has recently spread from South America to ravage Puerto Rico and likely responsible for the first wave of infections that have begun to occur in the United States. Zika has been declared a global health threat by the World Health Organization and is not addressed with a proven drug or vaccine therapy. According to the CDC, more than 7,300 Americans have been diagnosed with Zika virus infection, including 1,825 individuals in the continental U.S. and Hawaii. Researchers have linked Zika virus infection with Guillain-Barre syndrome, a severe neurological disorder that can cause paralysis. In pregnant women, Zika can cause Microcephaly, which results in babies being born with a small head and underdeveloped brain. Zika infection has also been associated with Arthrogryposis, a condition that results in deformities of joints in the arms and legs of newborns.

"As a result of our research team's validation of Zika capture, we have further reinforced the potential of our Hemopurifier(r) to be a first line of defense against the growing list of infectious viral pathogens that are not addressed with traditional drug or vaccine therapies," stated Aethlon Chairman and CEO, Jim Joyce.

[BioCryst Pharmaceuticals][4] ([NASDAQ:BCRX][5])

BioCryst Pharmaceuticals designs, optimizes and develops novel small molecule drugs that block key enzymes involved in rare diseases. BioCryst's ongoing development programs include oral plasma kallikrein inhibitors for hereditary angioedema; BCX7353 and other second generation compounds, and BCX4430, a broad spectrum viral RNA polymerase inhibitor. In March the Company announced that results from a preclinical study of its broad spectrum antiviral BCX4430 in immune-deficient mice infected with Zika virus would be presented at a World Health Organization (WHO) meeting scheduled to take place March 7-9 in Geneva, Switzerland. The primary goal of the study was to assess the effect of BCX4430 treatment on survival through Day 28 in immune-deficient mice infected with the Zika virus. BCX4430 was administered by intramuscular (I.M.) injection twice a day beginning four hours prior to virus challenge and continuing for eight days; two dose levels were tested. In the standard dose BCX4430 group, 7 of 8 mice survived through Day 28\. In the low dose BCX4430 group (n=8), and in control groups administered vehicle placebo (n=8) or ribavirin at two dose levels (n=16), no animals survived to Day 28\. Overall survival for the standard dose level of BCX4430 was superior to both the placebo and the ribavirin treatment control groups (p < 0.0001). For both dose levels of BCX4430, median survival was superior to both control groups (\>28 days for BCX4430 standard dose and 23 days for low dose) compared to 14 to 17 days for controls.

This study was conducted at Utah State University, under the ongoing Animal Models of Infectious Disease Program at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. This program provides in vivo screening services for researchers, as part of a broader suite of preclinical services supported by NIAID. These services are part of NIAID's infrastructure for responding to emerging infectious diseases, such as Zika virus, and allow for research to be quickly directed to support immediate public health needs.
